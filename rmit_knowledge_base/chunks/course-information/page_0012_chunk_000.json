  "text": "Received a postgraduate study offer? If you’ve received a conditional offer, you must wait until you have a full offer before you can accept. Once your conditions have been met, you will be issued a full offer. Once you accept the offer of your preferred program, the other offers will be automatically withdrawn. Once you accept an offer for one preference, your other preferences, which may be under assessment, will automatically be withdrawn. You may want to wait until you have received an outcome for all your preferences to decide on accepting the right program for you. Once you have an outcome for your preference(s), it is strongly recommended that you accept your offer as soon as possible. Otherwise, you may miss out on your preferred classes or your offer may lapse. If you haven’t already accepted before the deadline for your program, we will send you a reminder email. You won’t be able to reactivate your offer if you change your mind. You will need to re-apply for the same program for the next intake.",
