COURSE REGISTRATION - FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Q: When can I register for courses?
A: Registration opens 6 weeks before the semester begins. Your specific registration date and time are based on your classification and total credit hours completed.

Q: How do I register for courses?
A: Use the online student portal to search for courses, check availability, and add courses to your schedule. You can also register by phone or in person at the Registrar's Office.

Q: What if the course I need is full?
A: Add yourself to the waitlist through the online system. You'll be automatically enrolled if a spot opens up. You can also contact the academic department to request permission to enroll.

Q: Can I change my schedule after registering?
A: Yes! You can add or drop courses during the first two weeks of the semester without academic penalty. After the add/drop period, you may withdraw from courses but will receive a "W" grade.

A: Contact your academic advisor immediately. They can help you find alternative courses or sections that fit your schedule while meeting degree requirements.
